# Hey 👋 I'm Sarowar 

I'm a Computer Science student who likes building **backend systems**, breaking things to understand them, and experimenting with **GenAI and AI agents**.

I care more about *how things work* than just making them work.

---

## 👨‍💻 A bit about me

- 🎓 B.Tech CSE (2023–2027)
- 🔧 Mostly into **backend engineering**
- 🤖 Exploring **Generative AI & agent-based systems**
- 🧠 I practice DSA regularly (not perfect, but consistent)
- 🛠 I prefer building real projects over copy-paste tutorials

I enjoy writing clean APIs, thinking about system design, and slowly leveling up as an engineer.

---

## 🧰 Tech I work with

**Languages**
- Python, C++, JavaScript

**Backend**
- FastAPI
- Node.js, Express
- REST APIs, authentication, cookies & sessions
- WebSockets (real-time stuff)

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- SQLAlchemy, Sequelize

**GenAI**
- LLM-based apps
- Prompt engineering
- AI agents & tool calling
- RAG-style systems (learning + experimenting)

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- Linux
- Docker (basics)
- Streamlit
- Postman

---

## 📌 Projects I'm proud of

### 🔹 Repo2Readme
A developer tool that **automatically generates clean, structured README files** from a repository.

- Analyzes project structure
- Converts codebase → human-readable documentation
- Built to save developers time and improve repo quality

This project reflects how I think about **developer experience**, not just features.

---

### 🔹 JoluMate (GenAI Backend Project)
A backend-first GenAI system built using **FastAPI**.

- Authentication & user management
- Conversation and message handling
- Clean API design
- Designed with future **streaming & AI agents** in mind

This is my main playground for backend + GenAI ideas.

---

### 🔹 URL Shortener
A backend service built with **Node.js + PostgreSQL**.

- URL shortening & redirection
- Visit tracking
- Clean folder structure and database design

Simple idea, but done properly.

---

### 🔹 Machine Learning Projects
- House price prediction with full ML pipeline
- Vehicle price prediction using ensemble models
- Focus on **EDA, feature engineering, and evaluation**

---

## 📚 What I'm currently learning

- Backend system design (the real kind)
- AI agents: planning, memory, tools
- How LLMs actually work under the hood
- Core CS concepts that make backend engineers strong

---

## 🤝 Open to

- Backend / SWE internships
- Serious side projects
- Open-source collaboration
- Talking about backend, GenAI, or system design
